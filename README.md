# sudoku-solver
Simple sudoku solver in python using the backtracking algorithm<br/>
(currently only text based and doesn't seem to work on boards larger than 9x9 (yet))<br/><br/>
sudokumod.py -> the main file with the actual sudoku solver<br/>
sudokuboards.py -> the file containing a couple of example boards
